===========================

* Created bt Walid Nouh for GLPi 0.83
* Updated by Anthony Piesset and Dethegeek for GLPi 0.84
* Updated by Thierry Bugier Pineau for GLPi 0.85 and 0.90

Integration in GLPI 9.4
-----------------------

Beside what they wrote, the way that GLPI handle SIM Card in core modules is really awful.
Plugin is a lot better for Sim Card Management.


Integration in GLPI 9.2
-----------------------

Simcards will be available as a new component in GLPI 9.2. Therefore, for fresh installations of GLPI 9.2, this plugin becomes useless.
